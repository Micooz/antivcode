examples:
    First you should let the program study and generate attribute code database.
    To get help information:
        >> decode -h
        Or
        >> decode --help
    To study by filenames from ./folder and create a new database named "db" in ./database:
        >> decode -syn -d ./folder/ -b ./database/db
        Or
        >> decode -s -y -n -d ./folder/ -b ./database/db
    To study sigle file and append to database by default(./db):
        >> decode -s -f simples/studied.jpg
        if you want to see binaryzated image, just add -v option.

    When finish studying, you can run a test or recognition.
    To test a single file:
        >> decode -t -f simples/tested.jpg
    To test a series of images:
        >> decode -t -d test/
    Note: test procedure require that file named with a right name.
    To recognite a single file:
        >> decode -f simples/recognited.jpg
    To recognite a series of files:
        >> decode -d simples/
